## Typical Use Cases

- In-person **presentations** where people struggle to follow spoken English
- **Workshops / trainings** with international attendees
- **Team meetings** in a meeting room (not Zoom/Teams)

## FAQ

### Does SpeakBar upload audio to the cloud?
No. SpeakBar is designed to run **fully offline**.

### Why not just use Zoom/Teams captions?
Zoom/Teams captions work online. When you step into a **room with a projector**, captions often disappear. SpeakBar is built for that offline/in-person gap.

### What languages are supported?
SpeakBar focuses on **English subtitles** for live speaking. (More language support may come later.)

### System requirements?
- macOS 26+
